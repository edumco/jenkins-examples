# Docker installation

Running Jenkins on a container might give you more flexibility.

## I recommend the following images

### The official [jenkins/jenkins](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins)

The LTS tag for production and the weekly latest for evaluation

### The [saidsef/alpine-jenkins-dockerfile](https://github.com/saidsef/alpine-jenkins-dockerfile)

This image contains all the good stuff you're going to need and its based on the official LTS.

I recommend to make a fork from the original repository and tweak it for your project needs.
