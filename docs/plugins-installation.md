# Plugins installation

## Tutorials

In the [automation-resources repository](https://github.com/edumco/automation-resources) there are several tutorials and courses available (many of them are free).

## Essential Plugins

Some plugins unblock a giant set of functionality on Jenkins so you really need to read about them to see if they fit your needs. Here are some of my favorites:

### 1. [Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator/)

### 2. [Blue Ocean](https://plugins.jenkins.io/blueocean/)

### 3. [GitHub Authentication](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth/)

### 4. [Matrix Authorization Strategy](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-auth/)

### 5. [Gravatar](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gravatar/)

### 6. [Docker](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-plugin/)

### 7. [SSH Build Agents](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ssh-slaves/)

## Build tools

For every program language there is a a Jenkins plugin that can facilitate your build project. But with the Docker integration you probably wont need any plugin.
